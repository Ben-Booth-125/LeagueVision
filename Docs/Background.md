# Background
In order to have a strong chance at success for this project, we
will aim to use technology which is both simple for any programmer
to read, and also as cutting edge as possible. As such, we will
first research the background in any appropriate disciplines.

## Image Segmentation Models

### DETR
DETR is a popular library for image segmentation. Since this is
primarily a computer vision project, I will be using DETR to
detect visual objects for our product to work with.

## Large Language Models

### T5
We will consider T5 as a pre-trained model for language, simply
due to familiarity. If preliminary research returns more fitting
models then we will switch.
