# Introduction
This project aims to help users visualise their strategies, with
a combined AI approach.

## Components
For our users to interface with our product, they will have to be
able to review their own games, and create their own strategies.
This means we will have to provide an environment for users to
review their games, and save clips where they believe to have
spotted some hidden strategical insight.
  Once this has been done, we will utilise modern AI techniques
to consider how the gameplay may have unfolded if the user were
able to execute the strategy they imagine prior. This 
visualisation will be the essential challenge of our project, as
there is no strong evidence that this can be done right now.

## Image Segmentation
DETR is a popular library for image segmentation. Since this is
primarily a computer vision project, I will be using DETR to
detect visual objects for our product to work with.
